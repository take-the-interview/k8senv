- Secret providers writing down secrets directly to AWS secrets manager (AWS SM)
    - secrets.tfvars should point to secret addresses in AWS SM
    - terranova to be capable of creating/updating/destroying secrets
    - Provider (tf-aws-rds for example) to broadcast secrets addresses through outputs.tf.
      All secrets that are passed to other depending services trough state files should switch to AWS SM addresses of secrets instead of values
- For application runtime secrets shep should maintain AWSSM secrets the same way it's maintaining K8S ConfigMaps (with weight)
    - ENV variable should contain AWS SM secret address/name instead of value
    - ENV variable can reference AWS SM secret created by another TF template or the ones created with shep
    - Shep should be capable of interpolating secrets
    - k8senv capable of parsing ENV var references to secrets
    - Generating AWS SM IAM policy for app
